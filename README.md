## Hello, I'm ol (short for olmac / my real name)
I like making Roblox games and doing graphic design

Currently working on (and own) Roblox projects for Starstruck Studios, you can check out the website here: [starstruck-studios.top](https://starstruck-studios.top)

Recently, I've been working on small github projects (like StudioRPC which has just been released! It adds Roblox Studio activity to your Discord profile), mostly ran by python.

If my Python code sucks, it's because im new to Python.
You can check out my portfolio here: http://olmac.starstruck-studios.top/ (yes its the same website from before)
